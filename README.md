# Druga gimnazija enrollment system demo

This is a public demo repository of a website I developed for my school to aid in enrollment of new students. It saves students' data to a database, which can later be exported to Excel spreadsheets for the school, as well as provides a PDF download of a filled out form that students can print out, sign, and then bring to the school to finalize their enrollment process.
